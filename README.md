Miscellanea, minutiae, &amp;c. related to an antenna project for the 6-meter amateur radio band

## Setting

Up until now, I've worked on the 6-meter band mostly with a quarter-Î» vertical on the balcony,
and it hasn't been all bad. For example, during the midsummer peak, contacts around Europe were
possible on most days, and I was occasionally even able to get a bit farther away. Other
stations are usually horizontally polarized, though, and with a simple vertical there's zero
directivity. This leaves me deaf to even close-by stations during the less chocolate-y band
conditions.

Moxon antenna was brought up on the [#hamit.fi](https://hamit.fi/) IRC channel, and it seemed
like a simple enough one to construct. Here's our reference design
from [on5au.be](http://on5au.be/content/a10/moxon/6m.html):
